This code is a C++ program that simulates a restaurant reservation and ordering system. It allows a user to reserve a table, select a meal preference (main course, appetizers, or desserts), and place orders for specific food items. The program displays a menu card with various food items and their prices, and the user can select items to order. The program keeps track of the ordered items and their prices, and finally displays an order summary with the total price.

The code is organized into three classes: Table_reservation, Restaurant, and Client. The Table_reservation class handles table reservations, the Restaurant class represents the restaurant and its details, and the Client class represents a client and their details. The program uses vectors to store the food items and their prices, and to keep track of the ordered items and their prices. The program also uses string streams to read user input and manipulate strings. The code is written in a modular fashion, with each class and function having a specific responsibility, making it easy to understand and maintain. Overall, this code demonstrates a simple implementation of a restaurant reservation and ordering system using object-oriented programming principles in C++.
